A single page one column Functional resume for data analysts. It uses the latex templates and fonts from Sourabh Bajaj's resume template:https://github.com/sb2nov/resume. The template and its features make installation and resume updates easy. 

The different sections are clearly documented and custom commands are used to provide consistent formatting. The three main sections in the resume are education, experience and projects.

### Motivation

I created this as managing a resume on Google Docs was hard and changing any formatting was too difficult as had to be applied in multiple places. Most currently available templates either focus on two columns or are multiple pages. I personally found the two columns ones hard to focus while multi-page resumes were just two long to be used in career fairs.
